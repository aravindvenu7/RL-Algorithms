# RL-Algorithms
Tensorflow implementation of RL Algorithms.

This is a repo for iPython notebooks for Reinforcement Learning Algorithms I have implemented using Tensorflow and OpenAI Gym.Uptil now,the following work has been done:
1. Implementation of Gambler's Problem from Richard L. Sutton's book.
2. Policy Iteration Algorithm.
3. Q Learning with Function Approximation
4. Deep Q Learning
